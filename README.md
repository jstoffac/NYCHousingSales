The purpose of this repo is fulfill a classroom requirement for SMU's Doing Data Science Class, Post-live session Unit 4 Homework. The assignment was to take housing data from New York Cities Rolling Housing Sales data.  URL: http://www1.nyc.gov/home/search/index.page?search-terms=Rolling+sales+update Our group was tasked with looking at the Manhattan data in order to determine any signficant relationship between sales price and gross square footage.  This repo includes three directories that are rather self explanatory: Data, Analysis, and Findings.  The Data folder includes downloaded .csv and .xsl files of the original data along with an R script to read, clean, and create the dataframe we used in our analysis.  The Analysis folder includes a RStudio project file, an .html, and a .rmd file of our analysis.  Lastly, the Findings folder includes a short .rmd file with our limited findings.
